# Group 3 Fitness and Health Tracker Analysis Project
Project 3: Fitness and Health Tracker Analysis
🎯 Comprehensive Objective:
This project focuses on analyzing personal health and fitness tracking data to uncover trends in physical activity, hydration, sleep, and calorie expenditure across different age groups and genders. Students will utilize SQL to extract key insights, Excel for aggregation and comparative analysis, and Power BI to create dynamic dashboards that visualize wellness patterns. They will explore the relationship between lifestyle habits and fitness metrics, identify which exercise types yield the highest calorie burn, and assess whether people meet recommended health standards. By integrating data from a questionnaire, students can also personalize insights and offer practical wellness suggestions based on empirical evidence.
